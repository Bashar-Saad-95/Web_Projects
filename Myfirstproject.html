                    For a memorable meal the quality of the service is something that guests
                    often remember as much as the food and drink served.
                    That means that restaurant servers must show extensive 
                    knowledge of all types of cuisine and dishes, especially the 
                    ingredients and cooking style of the dishes on an a la carte menu. 
                    They will need to know and understand the methods of preparation and serving, 
                    along with the tools used.
